# TritonHacks-WebScraping
The python web scraping starter kit for TritonHacks2021
# This is my first ever trying out python, html, and css! 
## Inspiration
It's my dream to work at a big tech company, so I thought this Web Scraper Track would be the perfect first step for me! I think this concept would be perfect since I am able to build onto it!

## What it does
This website compares a food item of choice from two different locations! It also provides the average rating and average price for both locations.

## How I built it
I followed the instructional guide on Google Docs. I got mentoring from great tutors that got me to understand what to code. 

## Challenges we ran into
I was having a really hard time in the beginning because code was deleted from the instructions, but once I asked for help from tutors. I was able to understand the code once they explained it to me. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of learning Python, CSS and HTML within two days! I haven't coded in 3-4 years, which is my freshman year of high school. I proud of myself for actually completing this web scraper because I've never tried anything like this before! 

## What we learned
I learned that it's never too late to learn something new. And that it's okay to ask for help even if you're really shy or scared. I realized that I need to push myself to achieve my dreams; I will not learn if I don't try
## What's next for Food Wars
I want to customize this website more by adding a weather feature, creating a unique design, providing the top reviews, and finally by recommending the best rated restaurant in the two provided locations.
